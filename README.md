## Description

This website is a test for the first set of code. I wanted to learn how to organize my own system to allow for good studying habits and a support to look back on during my coding journey. It allows me to have a space to place all that i learn in an organized format that is clear and organized. It has taught me the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
